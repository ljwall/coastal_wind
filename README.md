# Coastal highlighting

Mapping fun using [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/).

## Get started

Clone, do `npm i`, and then `npx webpack-dev-server` to build and run the wbpack
development suerver.

Direct your browser to [localhost](http://localhost:8080).

## Where things are

- JS entries points (used by webpack) in `src/`.
- Built js in `dist/` (not in repo).
- Any other static things that aren't built by webpack go in `public/` (e.g.
  `index.html`).
